LIMITED WARRANTY: LICENSOR warrants to you (if you are the initial and
original purchaser of the Software) that the original storage medium
holding the Software is free from defects in material and workmanship
under normal use and service for 90 days from the date of purchase. If
for any reason you find a defect in the storage medium during the
warranty period, LICENSOR agrees to replace, free of charge, any
Software discovered to be defective within the warranty period as long
as the Software is currently being manufactured by LICENSOR. If the
Software is no longer available, LICENSOR retains the right to
substitute a similar program of equal or greater value. This warranty
is limited to the storage medium containing the Software as originally
provided by LICENSOR and is not applicable to normal wear and tear.
This warranty shall not be applicable and shall be void if the defect
has arisen through abuse, mistreatment, or neglect. Any implied
warranties prescribed by statute are expressly limited to the 90-day
period described above. 
Except as set forth above, this warranty is in lieu of all other
warranties, whether oral or written, express or implied, including any
other warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or
non-infringement, and no other representations or warranties of any
kind shall be binding on LICENSOR.
When returning the Software subject to the limited warranty above,
please send the original Software only to the LICENSOR address
specified below and include: your name and return address; a photocopy

IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM POSSESSION, USE OR MALFUNCTION OF
THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING DAMAGES TO PROPERTY, LOSS OF GOODWILL, COMPUTER
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION AND, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DAMAGES FOR
PERSONAL INJURIES, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES. LICENSOR'S LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE ACTUAL
PRICE PAID FOR USE OF THE SOFTWARE. SOME STATES/COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW
LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS AND/OR THE EXCLUSION
OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE
LIMITATIONS AND/OR EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY
